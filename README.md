  - DoFun installed and loaded. Related functions used are described.
  - FormTracer installed and loaded. Related definition of tensors and groups described and implemented.
  
- Template for the Dyson-Schwinger equations:
 
  - Definition of fields and action.
  - Definition of vertices and projections.
  - Derivation of the DSEs in a symbolic and algebraic form.
  - Exportation of the DSE equation to be used in the C++ codes. 
  
- Template for the Renormalisation Group equations:
