   Txt File for initial conditions


   This file was created to change the variables to fit without any need for
   compiling again.

   The values need to be written in the first line separated by a tab.
   The conditions used are:

   - Column 1     Number of external grid points np
   - Column 2     Number of internal Gauss-Legendre quadrature points nk
   - Column 3     Number of internal Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature
                  points nz (must never be larger than nk)
   - Column 4     Value for the infrared cutoff
   - Column 5     Value for the ultraviolet cutoff
   - Column 6     Renormalisation scale (to be squared)
   - Column 7     Number of colors Nc
   - Column 8     Number of flavors Nf
   - Column 9     Initial value for every A(p^2)
   - Column 10    Initial value for every B(p^2)
   - Column 11    Initial value for the renormalisation constant Z2
   - Column 12    Initial value for the renormalisation constant Zm
   - Column 13    Value for the bound state mass M (GeV);
   - Column 14    Relative error precision for convergence rel_err


   In order to add further (fewer) initial values, add (delete) more conditions
   and modify global_variable_reading() function in simpfunctionsDSE.hpp .
